# webschviewdiffmerge

This repository contains code that allows users to perform the following actions
on schematic files:
* View schematic files on the web
* Diff different versions of the schematic 
* Merge schematic files edited by multiple users 

The project is currently written with placeholders for CAD-tool specific parsing 
code. This code will not run as-is and needs parsing code as outlined in the
filetypes directory to function.
